# hello nd welcome to variables
# imagine a variable like a cup , it stores a value

welcome="welcome to my program"
# this is an example of a variable
# you name the variable
# then specify its value using the equals operator

# in python there are different types of variables
age=14 # this is an integer type
name="youre name" # this is a string, a string is basically a sequence of individual charachters, space is also a charachter
speed=14.5 # this is a float, a float is basically a decimal value
is_alive = True # this is a boolean, a boolean is a value which basically stores only two things they are true and false

# so those are variables in python
# you can see the types of those variables by using the type function
print(type(age))
print(type(name))
print(type(speed))
print(type(is_alive))
